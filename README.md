# Learning Haskell

Haskell is a wonderful language. It makes it simple to write clean, bug-free, modular and elegant code that is easy to refactor and reason about.

Moreover, it is one of the only languages to really take academic ideas about language design very seriously, while still being practical for industrial use.

However, it is significantly different in its approach from most other well-known languages, and this presents a challenging barrier to its use.

The goal of this book is to lower that barrier. 

Each chapter of the book is focused on explaining a module of code in the accompanying [codebase](). For example, [chapter 1]() discusses [src/chapter1.hs](). In each chapter, the goal is to explain all the code in that module fully. The code is chosen carefully so that explaining it amounts to a tour of a part of Haskell, starting from the very basics in chapter 1 and building upwards.

This book is intended to be a joint effort. If you would like to make a contribution, simply make a PR.
