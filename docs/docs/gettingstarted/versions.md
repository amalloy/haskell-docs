To change your version of GHC, cabal, or the Haskell Language Server:

```bash
> ghcup tui
```

You should see something like:

![](/img/ghcuptui.png)

This makes it easy to change version of the compiler, the Haskell language server, and cabal (the package manager).

??? stack
    `stack` is (roughly) an alternative package manager. Either `cabal` or `stack` work well, but this documentation defaults to `cabal`.
