## For newcomers

[These notes](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html) are excellent and friendly.

[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is a common favorite.

## Understanding the ecosystem

[This guide](https://github.com/Gabriella439/post-rfc/blob/main/sotu.md) is very useful for understanding what Haskell packages to use for what tasks.

## Going further

[This reference guide](https://smunix.github.io/dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/tutorial.pdf) carefully and clearly details more advanced concepts and features in Haskell.
