# Haskell

Haskell is a general purpose programming language. It is unique in being both very principled in its design (pure functions only, simple syntax, very expressive types), but also practical (heavily-engineered compiler that can generate fast code).

- Pros: highly modular code, low boilerplate, easy and safe refactoring
- Cons: no manual memory management, some [gaps in ecosystem](https://github.com/Gabriella439/post-rfc/blob/main/sotu.md)

Salient properties include:

- [functional](/thinkingfunctionally/hof)
- [pure](/thinkingfunctionally/purity) and [immutable](/thinkingfunctionally/immutability)
- [custom static types](/basics/createdata) with [inference](/thinkingfunctionally/typeinference)
- [lazy](/laziness/laziness)

## How to use this guide

If you're totally new to Haskell, we recommend reading through the tabs at the top of the page from the left to the right.

Feel free also to use this guide as a reference. For example, you can search the docs like so if you need a quick example of how to use a certain construction like `case`.
